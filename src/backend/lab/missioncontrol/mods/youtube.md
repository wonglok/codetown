Add a 🎬 YouTube tab to my Mission Control for planning video content. Include:

- Video ideas pipeline: cards with title, topic, status (idea/scripting/filming/editing/published), target publish date
- Add/edit ideas, move between statuses
- YouTube growth tracker: current sub count (editable), milestone levels with fun titles (e.g., "Rising Creator" at 1K, "Growth Engine" at 10K), XP-style progress bar to next milestone
- Content calendar: simple month grid showing planned publish dates
- All data in localStorage, match existing theme
