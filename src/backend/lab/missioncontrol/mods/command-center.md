Add a 🏢 Command Center tab to my Mission Control for managing my AI agents/team. Include:

- Agent cards in a grid: each shows name, role/title, status (online/busy/offline with colored dots), model being used, last active timestamp
- Click agent card to open a slide-out detail panel with: full description, capabilities list, recent activity log, performance notes
- "Send Task" button that opens a modal with a text area (simulates sending tasks — saves to agent's activity log)
- Executive Decisions section below agents: list of key decisions made with date, question asked, decision summary, which agents were consulted
- Store all agent data in localStorage, include 3-4 sample agents to start
