Add a 📞 Meetings tab to my Mission Control. Include:

- Upcoming meetings list: title, date/time, attendee(s), type (call/zoom/in-person), prep notes
- Add/edit/delete meetings
- Each meeting card expands to show: agenda items (editable checklist), notes textarea, action items that come out of it
- Past meetings archive (auto-moves when date passes)
- Today's meetings highlighted at top with countdown timers
- localStorage persistence, match theme
